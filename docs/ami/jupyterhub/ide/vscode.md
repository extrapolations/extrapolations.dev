# VSCode

You can access VS Code by clicking on the `VS Code` icon on Jupyter Lab.

The VS Code Python and Jupyter extensions are installed so it's possible to start coding
Python out of the box and it's possible install other extensions.

!!! warning "HTTPS Requirement"

    In order to use some features of VS Code such as the Python Interpreter
    you need to configure [HTTPS](/ami/jupyterhub/https/). This is a requirement of VSCode.

!!! info "Python interpreter"

    Be sure to select the correct Python interpreter under `/opt/python`.
    For more info see [Python](/ami/jupyterhub/python).

You can easily install other extensions by clicking on the `Extensions` icon on the left.
