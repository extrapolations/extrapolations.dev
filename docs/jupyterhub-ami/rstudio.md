# RStudio IDE

You can access the RStudio IDE by clicking on the `RStudio` icon on Jupyter Lab.

The only difference between using R from Jupyter and RStudio is that
RStudio is limited to one version of R (the latest installed in the system).

You can use all the features from the RStudio IDE such as developing Shiny Apps.
