In he `Create endpoint` page:

1. You will be sent to the `Create endpoint` wizard on the Amazon SageMaker console
    1. Name the model, e.g. `gpt-2`

## 3. Making a query

With the SageMaker Endpoint ready you will have an HTTP endpoint to make predictions, for example:

```
https://runtime.sagemaker.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/endpoints/gpt-2/invocations
```

### Insonmia

To test the endpoint you can use the [Insonmia HTTP client](https://insomnia.rest)
that supports AWS Authentication.

Create a new `POST` request and select the Auth method `AWS IAM v4`,
fill the credentials, region and use `sagemaker` as the service.

Select `JSON` as the body type and use the following test query:

```
{
    "input": "This is an input text"
}
```

With a response like this:

```
[
  "This is an input text box that will be used to input the password. The user may select a user name and password to save for later.\n\nPassword fields allow users to save themselves as a user on our server, which may be useful for",
  "This is an input text for the next button.\n\nYou can also press the backspace key twice to erase the text to the right.\n\nPressing the backspace key again to clear the previously typed text will delete the previous line.",
  "This is an input text for the widget, and it must be in the correct format. The format must be one of the following:\n\n\nText to enter on the form\n\nExample: What is the total distance in miles to your next destination"
]
```
